BUT : recoder les containers de la STL

pas de fct dans un fichier d'en tete
fichiers d'en tete separés
namespaces doit etre ft
ne pas utiliser un tableau pour map
si le container standars a x fct public = ne pas depasser ce nombre
        --> donc mettre le rest des fct en privé
il faut recoder tte les fct membre et non membre d'un containers ainsi que les surcharges
si le containers a un system d'iterator il faut le mettre
il faut utiliser std::allocator
pour les surcharges non membre on a le droit a friend 
        ---> ex : map::value_compare = friend autorisé

/* TO DO :3 containers
- Sequence container = vector
- Container adaptor = stack
- Associative container = map
*/
PROB :
In C++98, there's no built-in support for a vector data structure.
However, we can emulate a vector-like functionality by
- using an array
- & implementing functions to handle resizing
- & other common vector operations and stuff

//==============================================================================
Basic implementation of vector class in C++98

class Vector {
        public:
        //---------------------------------------------
        Vector() : _size(0), _capacity(8), _data(new int[_capacity] { }
        //---------------------------------------------
        ~Vector() {delete[] _data;}
        //---------------------------------------------
        void push_back(int value) {
                if (_size == _capacity)
                        resize();
                _data[_size++] = value;
        }
        //---------------------------------------------
        void pop_back() {
                if (_size > 0)
                        _size--;
        }
        //---------------------------------------------
        int& operator[](int index) {return _data[index];}
        //---------------------------------------------
        int at(int index) {
                if (index < 0 || index >= _size)
                        throw "Index out of range";
                return _data[index];
        }
        //---------------------------------------------
        int getSize() {return _size;}
        //---------------------------------------------
        int getCapacity() {return _capacity;}
        //---------------------------------------------
        private:
                int*    _data;
                int     _size;
                int     _capacity;
                //---------------------------------------------
                void resize() {
                        _capacity *= 2;
                        int* newData = new int[_capacity];
                        for (int i = 0; i < _size; i++)
                                newData[i] = _data[i];
                        delete[] _data;
                        _data = newData;
                }
};
//==============================================================================
This Vector class has basic functionality like :

push_back()
pop_back()
operator[]
at()
getSize()
getCapacity()

It uses an array to store the data
It automatically resizes the array when the capacity is reached
It is important to note that C++98 does not have move semantics
So when resizing the array the elements need to be copied individually.

//==============================================================================
You can use this Vector class like this:

Vector v;
v.push_back(1);
v.push_back(2);
v.push_back(3);

cout << v.at(1) << endl; // prints 2
cout << v.getSize() << endl; // prints 3
cout << v.getCapacity() << endl; // prints 8
//==============================================================================
I did not include an allocator_type.
An allocator_type is a class template that's used to manage memory allocation and deallocation for container classes
such as std::vector.

In C++98, allocators were not a part of the standard library, so they had to be implemented manually.
It's not necessary to include an allocator_type in the Vector class that I provided
because it simply uses the new and delete operators to manage memory allocation & deallocation.
However, to have more control over memory management or to use custom memory allocation, just implement an allocator_type.
C++11 introduces the std::allocator, which is a class that can be used as an allocator_type for container classes.
The std::allocator provides a standard-compliant & general-purpose allocator that can be used with many different types of memory resources.
//==============================================================================
Here's a simple implementation with an allocator_type

template <typename T, typename Alloc = std::allocator<T> > // vscode needs a space between two > otherwise it goes banana
class Vector {
        public:
        //---------------------------------------------
        Vector() : _size(0), _capacity(8), _data(_alloc.allocate(_capacity)) { }
        //---------------------------------------------
        ~Vector() {
                for (int i = 0; i < _size; ++i) {
                        _alloc.destroy(&_data[i]);
                }
                _alloc.deallocate(_data, _capacity);
        }
        //---------------------------------------------
        void push_back(const T& value) {
                if (_size == _capacity) {
                        resize();
                }
                _alloc.construct(&_data[size++], value);
        }
        //---------------------------------------------
        void pop_back() {
                if (_size > 0) {
                        _alloc.destroy(&_data[--size]);
                }
        }
        //---------------------------------------------
        T& operator[](int index) {return _data[index];}
        //---------------------------------------------
        T at(int index) {
                if (index < 0 || index >= _size) {
                        throw "Index out of range";
                }
                return _data[index];
        }
        //---------------------------------------------
        int getSize() {return _size;}
        //---------------------------------------------
        int getCapacity() {return _capacity;}
        //---------------------------------------------
        private:
                Alloc   _alloc;
                T*      _data;
                int     _size;
                int     _capacity;
                //---------------------------------------------
                void resize() {
                        _capacity *= 2;
                        T* newData = _alloc.allocate(_capacity);
                        for (int i = 0; i < _size; i++) {
                                _alloc.construct(&newData[i], _data[i]);
                                _alloc.destroy(&_data[i]);
                        }
                        _alloc.deallocate(_data, _capacity);
                        _data = newData;
                }
};
//===============================================================================================================//
Vector class template takes two template arguments:
- the type of the elements stored in the vector (T)
- an allocator class (Alloc)

By default, it uses std::allocator, which is a class that can be used as an allocator_type for container classes.
The allocator class provides several member functions such as: 
- allocate()
- construct()
- destroy()
- deallocate()
which are used to manage memory allocation and deallocation.

This example uses the default constructor of the allocator
which will use the global new and delete operators to allocate and deallocate memory.

This version is not a production-ready code & it has some limitations
For example, it does not handle exceptions, it does not have a copy constructor or copy assignment operator.

Iterators

Iterators are a wrapper around a pointer that must behave in a certain way.
If you have an extra hour and a half, click here
Basically, if you describe an 'iterator' class that behaves according to the documentation
https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/RandomAccessIterator/
Then congratulations! You have created your iterator.
Great link with step by step instructions for implementing your own iterator:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3582608/how-to-correctly-implement-custom-iterators-and-const-iterators
https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs361/latest/Public/treetraversal/index.html

At some point, you need a vector constructor with iterators, and you stumble upon the fact that two constructors have the same number of parameters.
How to let the compiler know which one to call? enable_if comes to the rescue!
Well written here: https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/type_traits/enable_if/
But before jumping straight into the enable_if implementation, it would be good to understand the SFINAE (Substitution failure is not an error) idiom.
The material is presented quite well here: http://scrutator.me/post/2016/12/12/sfinae.aspx
Also, during implementation, certain difficulties may arise with understanding patterns, namely, what specialisation is and why it is needed.

is_integral

In C++, std::is_integral is a type trait that provides compile-time information about whether a type is an integral type or not; such as int, long, char, and bool.
It evaluates to std::true_type if the type is an integral type, and to std::false_type otherwise.

Imagine you're at a 42cafet and you're trying to decide what kind of drinks to serve.
Some people prefer coffee (integral types) and some prefer tea (non-integral types).
You don't want to accidentally serve coffee to someone who hates it, so you ask your friend, "Hey, is this drink an integral type?"
In C++, std::is_integral is like that friend. It helps you determine whether a type is a tea drinker or a coffee drinker. If it's a coffee drinker, std::is_integral will give you a thumbs up and say, "Yep, it's an integral type." If it's not, it will shake its head and say, "Nope, not an integral type."
So the next time you're trying to serve drinks in C++, just ask std::is_integral to help you out!

Equal and/or lexicographical_compare

Are standard library algorithms that do comparisons as you can guess
- Equal is a fact template that compares elements of 2 ranges & return a boolean
it takes 3 arg std::equal(range1.begin(), range1.end(), range2.begin())
- lexicographical_compare compares the whole ranges from begin to end
it returns true if ranges elements are differents
it returns true if the 1st range's elements are less than the 2nd (=> range1 is lexicographical LESS than range2)
it returns TRUE if they are the same

introduction to tree traversal in C++
https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs361/latest/Public/treetraversal/index.html
A tree is a data structure that is made up of nodes, where each node can have zero or more child nodes.
Each node in a tree has a value, and the order in which the nodes are visited is referred to as tree traversal.
This link explains three different methods for tree traversal: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.
- Pre-order: This method visits the root node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
- In-order: This method visits the left subtree first, then the root node, and finally the right subtree.
- Post-order: This method visits the left subtree first, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.
This page includes C++ code examples for each of these three methods, along with visual representations of the tree to help illustrate how the different methods work.

It's similar to decorating a cake, but instead of icing and toppings, we have "nodes".
Have you ever wondered about the different ways to decorate a cake layer by layer?
well in C++, that's called "tree traversal".
There are three ways to do it: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.

* Pre-order: We start by putting the main decoration (the "root node") on top of the cake, then we add decorations to the left side of the cake, and finally, we add decorations to the right side.

* In-order: We start by adding decorations to the left side of the cake, then we put the main decoration (the "root node") on top of the cake, and finally, we add decorations to the right side.

* Post-order: We start by adding decorations to the left side of the cake, then we add decorations to the right side, and finally, we put the main decoration (the "root node") on top of the cake.

You might ask which order to choose? As a pastry chef, you know that the order in which you decorate a cake can make all the difference in how it looks and tastes.
In the same way, the order in which you visit the nodes in a tree in computer programming can affect the outcome of your program.
Here are a few things to consider when choosing the right tree traversal order:
- Decoration sequence: Just like you choose the order of decorations based on what looks best, you can choose the tree traversal order based on the desired order of processing the data in each node.
- Finding the perfect toppings: If you're looking for a specific decoration for your cake(=code), like a cherry, you can choose a tree traversal order that makes finding it easier.
- Cake reconstruction: If you want to rebuild the same cake later, you'll want to choose the order of decorations that makes it easier to recreate the cake (=re use the fct).
- Space for decorations: Just like you need enough space to store all your decorations, you'll also need to consider the amount of memory required to store the tree traversal sequence when choosing the order.
   In the end, choosing the right tree traversal order is all about making sure your program gets the desired outcome.
Just like making sure your cake looks and tastes amazing!
